We are the pioneers of associative, semiotic, hypergraph technology, also known as [R3DM/S3DM][3]. TRIADB is an innovative, high-level multi-perspective database framework that implements this technology in Python. It is a middle-layer application that sits on top of suitable NoSQL DBMS that enables them to perform easily integration, correlation and aggregation of multiple data resources. Currently there are two prototypes implemented one for [OrientDB with Mathematica][1] and another on top of [Intersystems Cache with Python and Pandas][2].
