We are the pioneers of associative, semiotic, hypergraph technology, also known as [R3DM/S3DM][1]. [TRIADB][2] is an innovative, high-level multi-perspective database framework that implements this technology in Python. It is a middle-layer application that sits on top of suitable NoSQL DBMS that enables them to perform easily integration, correlation and aggregation of multiple data resources.
